            Views in a Vue.js project typically represent the different pages or routes of your application. 
            They are responsible for displaying the content to the user based on the current URL or route. 
            In Vue Router, which is commonly used for managing routing in Vue.js applications, 
            each route is associated with a specific view component. These view components can contain 
            other components, layouts, or directly render content.
